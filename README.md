Hello and welcome to this repository. 
   In here is my journey towards achieving my long held passion of applying computational tools to solve some of the world's most pressing problems. 
  The importance of computational tools in modern biology is often underscored yet with the right tools and expertise we could drive ideas into interesting directions.
 Thank you for reading and I hope you enjoy following me as I take baby steps towards my career as a research scientist.
  Nelson.
